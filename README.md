# InStock Project
​
This project has been completed in a group of 4 people.</br>
It was such a great experience collaborating with others</br>
delivering this project within the deadline.</br>
​
In this project we practiced chunking an existing</br>
site into React components and converting an</br>
existing static site into a React app.</br>
We also used Knex database in this project to retrieve the information</br>

We collaborated for this project using git and we came across </br>
lots of merge conflicts as well while we were merging all of</br>
our work. We learned how to effectively resolve a merge conflict</br>
and make the website work.</br>

​
**Update1**: We have added functional Search bar to our app🥳</br>
**Update2**: We have added error handling functions</br>
for all forms which was quite challenging💥.</br>
